# Ping Pong Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Ping Pong Game! This is a classic arcade-style game where two players (or one player against AI) compete to score points by bouncing a ball back and forth across the screen. The game is built using Python and Pygame, featuring vibrant colors, customizable game modes, and simple yet engaging gameplay.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against an AI-controlled ping. The AI has a 10% chance of missing the ball, adding a level of challenge.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Compete against a friend in a head-to-head match.
- **Randomized Ball Direction**: The ball’s initial direction and angle are randomized after each point is scored.
- **Stylish Score Display**: The score is prominently displayed in the center of the screen, providing a clear view of the game progress.
- **Customizable Visuals**: The game features a vibrant and light color scheme for an enjoyable visual experience.
